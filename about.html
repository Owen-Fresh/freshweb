      <p>I am Owen Cook (He/Him), a Graphic Design student at Portland State University.<br>
        Born and raised here in Portland, Oregon, I first found my passion for design while taking a 2D Design class at Clackamas Community College. I found a connection with the challenge of using creative problem solving to make interesting visual solutions. While there, I developed a love for animation and motion design from the strong offering of animation classes that the college provides.<br>
        I then transferred my credits to PSU to continue my journey as a designer, where I have developed a much more well-rounded skillset in the incredible Graphic Design program. My fascination with the with how people interact with technology and my love for animation led to me finding my passion in design: User Interface and User Experience.<br>
        I am currently working as the Student Web Designer for Student Media Tech at PSU. I collaborate with the Tech Advisor and Student Web Developer to maintain and improve upon the websites for Portland Stateâ€™s Student Media groups, such as the PSU Vanguard, KPSU Radio Station, and pathos Literary Magazine.</p>

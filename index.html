      <p>I am Owen Cook (He/Him), a Graphic Design student at Portland State University.
        <br> Born and raised here in Portland, Oregon, I first found my passion for design while taking an art class at Clackamas Community College. I found a connection with the challenge of using creative problem solving to make interesting visual solutions. From there, I transferred my credits to PSU to continue my journey as a designer.
        <br> My areas of interest in the field are UI/UX, Web Development, and Motion Design. I am most fascinated with how we as users interact with technology and interfaces.

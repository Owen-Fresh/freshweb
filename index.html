        <p>I am Owen Cook (He/Him), a Graphic Design student at Portland State University. 
          <br>My areas of interest in the fields are UI/UX, Web Development, and Motion Design. I am most fascinated with how we as users interact with technology and interfaces.
          <br>Feel free to take a look around; I&apos;ve got plenty of things that I&apos;m excited to share with you! 
          <br>The main draw of this site is definitely to see a portfolio of my Design work, but you can also learn more About me and what I&apos;m Working on currently. 
          <br>There is also a link to my Repository site, which I keep as both a repository for work, but also as a sort of scratch paper if there&apos;s something that I want to try out.
          <br>Thanks for coming by, and good luck, have fun!
        </p>
        <p>-Owen</p>

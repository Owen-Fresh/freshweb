      <p>I am currently doing a complete redesign of this site. I built the first version of freshweb completely from scratch without any prior knowledge of coding by following YouTube tutorials that I found. I was able to take classes in my program that gave me a much better understanding of web design and development, along with my job as a Web Designer, so I thought that now would be the perfect time to take a crack at starting out fresh with a much more informed approach.</p>
      <p>The legacy version of freshweb will be added to my Repository site, so feel free to go over there to see what I've got put up on it!</p>
      <p>Once Fall term starts up, I'll be getting started on my Senior Thesis, as well as taking class for Motion Graphics and Creative Coding. It'll be the first term of my senior year, so I am feeling ready to start but scared to finish.</p>
